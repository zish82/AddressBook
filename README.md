# AddressBook

1. I have used TDD, each Task relates to a Unit Test. I have tried to used KISS principle instead of complicating things.
2. I have Mocked interfaces instead of implementing them.
3. Knowing you will be looking to see how i approach the tasks, I have only written Unit Tests and did not write any 
Integration Tests which would have required actual implemetation. IGetAddressBook interface can be easily 
implemented and https://joshclose.github.io/CsvHelper/ can be used for reading given text file.
4. I will be happy to write Integration Tests and implement IGetAddressBook interface if that's needed.
